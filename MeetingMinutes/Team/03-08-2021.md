## Topics Discussed

This week the team discussed presenting the work we've done for the most recent iteration. For our mentor feedback, we didn't have too much so the slide within the presentation was bare bones. 
Our mentor was proud of us for the work we had accomplished and recommended changing up the radio buttons. 
Our client, Trey, was similarly impressed with what we had accomplished thus far and suggested various improvements for the last iteration. 
He suggested using a trimodal toggle switch for our search filters. Another suggestion of his was using Signal R, but it certainly wasn't a requirement. 
For our fifth iteration, the team wishes to clear our tech debt, establish a concrete aesthetic for the web page, and implement messaging full stack which is where the client's recommendation of Signal R comes in. 


## Things Clarified

Our team meeting allowed us to prepare for our eventual presentation, and clarify what we were going to discuss. 
As a group, we made sure to clarify what each of us contributed during this iteration for the final slide. The team learned from Trey that Signal R is widely used within the industry because of its observer design pattern and it would be beneficial for all of us to learn it during the final iteration.
