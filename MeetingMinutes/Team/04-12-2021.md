## Topics Discussed

After having a long meeting the previous day and just having the client meeting the team wanted to make this a shorter meeting. We divided the work amongst the 
four of us for what we needed to do for the presentation for iteration five. We also discussed what we were happy with about this iteration and what went well overall
with the project.

## Things Clarified

There was an understanding that the team was happy with the progress that we have made since the first iteration last semester. With everyone given tasks to finish out
the last iteration we were ready to present iteration five.
