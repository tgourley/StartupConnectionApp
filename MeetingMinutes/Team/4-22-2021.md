## Topics Discussed
We discussed what we needed to do for our clean up before we hand the project off to our client. We also discovered a bug and determined what was worth finishing in the end. 
Since this meeting was after the final iteration, it was short and to the point, even though we worked on the bug for a little bit.

## Things Clarified
I was assigned working on the pitch bug we discovered. We also clarified that we are planning to ship it to trey almost as the software is, except for a few small bugs that we
wanted to fix.
