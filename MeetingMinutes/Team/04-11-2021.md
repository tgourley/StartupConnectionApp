## Topics Discussed
We discussed what everyone had gotten done with our extra iteration time, and since our last meeting 2 days ago. We worked on merging everything together along with the last 
finishing touches, running into much more errors than we had anticipated. The biggest issue was that everyone who had done frontend CSS work had inadvertantely messed up other
pages with thier changes, and so a lot of the CSS work had to be redone. 

## Things Clarified
We all gained a better understanding of how to properly do CSS, and why not to use generic CSS tabs. We also all learned where we were going to be at the end of this iteration
(tonight), and therefore the project as this is the final iteration.
