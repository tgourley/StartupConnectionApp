## Topics Discussed

The team discuessed and demonstrated what we had gotten done. Chris had completed adding users to a new chat, Jim tested some of the backend and had begone working
on the layout of pitch pages, Julian had continued working in the frontend cleaning the search buttons and nav bar, and Robert worked on front-end testing. After this 
we discussed where we expected to be by the end of this iteration, based on what we currently had completed.

## Topics Clarified

The team clarified that we believe we will be able to finish strong with the messaging feature and have a more clean user interface. The cleanness of the code
has been seen getting better, and we disscussed it would be satisfactory by the end of this iteration. Testing will be mostly complete, at minimum testing our big 
features.
