## Topics Discussed

This week the team discussed our progress with the capstone project so far in the final iteration as well as the individual roles we currently occupy within the project. 
My duty will continue to be to work on the CSS and anything related to the visual aesthetics of our code base.  
At the start of this iteration, my docker was malfunctioning but with the help of Jim it was quickly fixed and running. Chris is focusing on the implementation of Signal R.
So far, Chris has made significant progress with Signal R and chat messaging.
By the end of this iteration the team plans to have messaging fully implemented, all the tech debt cleared out, and the project aesthetics looking professional. 

## Topics Clarified

I will attempt to implement a trimodal toggle switch to replace the radio buttons after touching up the CSS and making the aesthetics flow better. 
Chris will continue to work on Signal R implementation and hooking it in with chat messaging.
