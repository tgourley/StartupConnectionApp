## Topics Dicussed

We showed off our finished software to Evan at this meeting. Prior to the meeting we ran into issues while merging, but sorted them out for the meeting. Evan ran through our
software through remote control on zoom and commented on how he liked our aesthetic improvements (from our CSS work). He was also happy to see the messaging feature up and
running, and overall seemed happy with the progress we made.

## Topics Clarified

The group got to see the results of our work in action with a "user", and got to see his pain points and where things worked well. Our chat system adding users is a bit weird,
for example, as the window does not disappear after adding a user, something which Evan found confusing for a moment. Overall, Evan seemed happy with the state of our project!
