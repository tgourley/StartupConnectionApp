## Topics Discussed
In this meeting, we began by closing up on the project. We gave Trey access to our repository on GitLab and he transferred it to his personal repository. We also discussed 
what we need to do on the documentation for Okta. The meeting was quick and concise.


## Things Clarified

The repository will be open for us until the end of the semester for any closing work we want to do before it becomes Trey's code.
