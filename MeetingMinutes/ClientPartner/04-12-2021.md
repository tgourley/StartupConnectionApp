## Topics 

During this final client meeting, we showed Trey our progress over the last few weeks and how far we've come with the project. Things went smoothly and he was impressed by what we were able to accomplish during the school year. 
He originally used our website with his tablet, but transferred to his laptop so things would work more smoothly. We pointed out to him the aesthetics changes and he liked them. 
After pointing out the aesthetics changes, we showed Trey the changes to messaging. Multiple users can be added to chat, and a user can have multiple chats.


## Things Clarified

One of his suggestions was to update the pitch links with the pitch name so when someone is looking through their history it'll be easier to find it. 
We showed Trey how to add new users to a chat and Chris opened up a new instance of the chat in a different window and sent a message into the chat box, which worked as intended.
